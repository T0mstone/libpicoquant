-write interface to file types
-detect hardware versions appropriately.
-for interfacing SWIG, we need a 32-bit version of Python. Perhaps it will be easier to get things working with ctypes, rather than playing with all of the issues of having 32-bit libraries floating around?
-write automated tests
-run valgrind against real, broken data to check for memory leaks
-check the hydraharp, other results against those generated by the picoquant demonstration file parsers
-get read/write of arrays working in swig
-switch the string interface to a bytearray interface? (%include <pybuffer.i>)
