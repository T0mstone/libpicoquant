.SH DESCRIPTION
.B picoquant
Decodes PicoQuant binary formats into ascii for use with photon correlation
code. 

.SS Input formats
The following input file formats are supported:

\fITimeHarp\fR
.TS
tab (@);
l l.
v2.0@thd
v3.0@thd, t3r
v5.0@thd
v6.0@thd, t3r
.TE

\fIPicoHarp\fR
.TS
tab (@);
l l.
v2.0@phd, pt2, pt3
.TE

\fIHydraHarp\fR
.TS
tab (@);
l l.
v1.0@hhd, ht2, ht3
v2.0@hhd, ht2, ht3
.TE

.SS Output formats
There are three major output formats: histogram, t2, and t3. 

\fIHistogram\fR mode refers to interactive (*hd) or continuous acquisition
(*hc), and consists of the association of an integer number of events with a
particular time bin. Data of this form are output as: 

	curve number, time bin (left edge), time bin (right edge), counts

\fIT2\fR mode refers to TTTR data where events are associated with a time
relative to the start of the experiment. These are output as:

	channel number, arrival time

\fIT3\fR mode refers to TTTR data where events are associated with a sync
pulse number relative to the start of the experiment, and an arrival time
relative to the sync pulse. These are output as:

	channel number, arrival pulse, relative arrival time

.SH OVERVIEW

.SH OPTIONS

.SS General options
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-\-help
Display a usage message.

.TP
.BR \-V ", " \-\-version
Display the version of the program.

.TP 
.BR \-v ", " \-\-verbose
Display debug messages during exectution, sent to stderr. 

.SS Files and formats
.TP
.BR \-i ", " \-\-file-in " FILENAME"
Specifies the name of the binary-format file to read. By default this is stdin.
The file is expected to be either a file output by PicoQuant software or raw
data from the hardware. In the former, the header will be used to process the
contents of the file automatically, but for the latter it is necessary to
specify the hardware name (--hardware) and version (--format-version).

.TP
\fb-o, --file-out\fR \fIFILENAME\fR
Specifies the name of the file to write to. By default this is stdout.
The exact output format will depend on the mode of the measurement, but all
are some form of ascii comma-delineated lines representing individual records.

.TP
.BR \-b ", " \-\-binary-out
The default behavior is to output ascii data. With this flag, the program
will instead output the binary form of that data.

.TP
.BR \- ", " \-\-hardware " " [HARDWARE]
This must be specified with --format-version.
The program normally uses the header of the file to determine the hardware 
type and data format version, but for raw data coming off the hardware there 
is no header. Use these two options to bypass the automatic detection code 
and instead directly access the desired decoder.

.TP
.BR \- ", " \-\-format-version " " [VERSION]
See --hardware.

.SS Debug and auxilliary
.TP
.BR \-p ", " \-\-print-every " " [NUMBER]
Prints a status message to stderr after processing every NUMBERth record 
in TTTR mode. This includes a time and record number, and is intended to 
provide an external means for tracking process.

.TP
.BR \-z ", " \-\-resolution-only
Print the resolution of the measurement. This is a single float for 
continuous, t2, and t3 mode, and is a float per curve in interactive mode, on 
separate lines. 

.TP
.BR \-r ", " \-\-header-only
Print the file header information, in an ini format.

.TP
.BR \-m ", " \-\-mode-only
Print the mode of the measurement (interactive, continuous, t2, t3).

.TP
.BR \-t ", " \-\-to-t2
For t3-mode data, use the input rate at the sync channel to convert the data
to its t2 representation. 

.TP
.BR \-n ", " \-\-number " " [NUMBER]
Process only the first NUMBERth records (TTTR mode).
