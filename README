To build, first build and install libpicoquant. This can be accomplished by:
> cd src
> make install clean

Next, build the Python modules:
> cd ..
> python setup.py install

On Windows, compile with mingw. To do this, make sure to:
1. Create \Lib\distutils\distutils.cfg, add
[build]
compiler=mingw32

2. Remove all references to -mno-cygwin from Lib\distutils\cygwincompiler.py
